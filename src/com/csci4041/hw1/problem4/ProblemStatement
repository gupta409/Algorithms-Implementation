Problem 4. (30 points)
Assume you have a list of names that you want to sort in alphabetical order. Use bucket sort to solve
this problem (i.e. the program should run in average case O(n)). However, use bucket sort recursively
to ensure that each of the final buckets that are sorted via insertion sort contain no more than 10
elements/names. The way you would do this is when sorting each bucket, if there are more than 10
elements/names in the bucket then you would create sub-buckets and run a mini-bucket sort on only the
elements in this large bucket. You may assume there are no spaces in the names and only contain
normal English alphabet characters. Also the first letter of names will be capitalized.

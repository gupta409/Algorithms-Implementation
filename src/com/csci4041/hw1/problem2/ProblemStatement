Problem 2. (30 points)
Build a data compression system using the Huffman’s algorithm. In other other words, you are given a
sequence of alphabet characters and you are asked to construct the Huffman’s code. Your “output.txt”
file should have the bit representation for every character that appears in the file (and should not
contain characters that are NOT present in the input file).
Sample output.txt (any valid Huffman code in this format):
a:0 
b:101 
c:100 
d:111 
e:1101 
f:1100 
Sample input.txt (all characters on a single line with no spaces bewteen):
ffffeeeeeeeeefccccccccccccbbbbbbbbbbbbbddddddddddddddddaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
